# White Screen Issue Fix - Personality Questionnaire Page

## Problem Statement
After registration, users encountered a white screen when arriving at the personality questionnaire page (question 1/10).

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Empty State Handling**
The build method didn't check if `_questions` list was empty. When questions failed to load or the API returned an empty array, the PageView would render with `itemCount: 0`, causing a blank/white screen.

**Fix**: Added explicit check for empty questions list and show a user-friendly error message with retry button.

### 2. **ListView.builder Inside SingleChildScrollView**
The `_buildQuestionOptions` method used a `ListView.builder` without `shrinkWrap: true` and `physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()`. This causes rendering issues when a ListView is nested inside a SingleChildScrollView.

**Fix**: Added `shrinkWrap: true` and `physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` to the ListView.builder.

### 3. **Hardcoded Scale Range (1-5 instead of 1-10)**
The scale question widget was hardcoded to show 1-5 options, but backend questions use 1-10 scale. This mismatch could cause confusion and UI issues.

**Fix**: 
- Updated scale widget to dynamically use `minValue` and `maxValue` from the question
- Changed from `Row` to `Wrap` for better layout with 10 options
- Adjusted circle size based on scale range (larger for 1-5, smaller for 1-10)

### 4. **Insufficient Error Handling**
The error handling in both the page and provider didn't properly handle cases where the API returns an empty array (not an error, but empty data).

**Fix**: Enhanced error handling in both `PersonalityQuestionnairePage` and `ProfileProvider` to detect and report empty question arrays.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/lib/features/onboarding/pages/personality_questionnaire_page.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added empty questions check in `build()` method with user-friendly UI
- Added `shrinkWrap: true` and `physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` to ListView.builder
- Updated scale widget to use dynamic min/max values from question
- Changed scale layout from Row to Wrap for better handling of 10 options
- Enhanced logging in `_loadPersonalityQuestions()`
- Improved error messages

### 2. `/lib/features/profile/providers/profile_provider.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added check for empty questions array in `loadPersonalityQuestions()`
- Enhanced logging to report when questions are loaded successfully
- Set error state when empty questions are returned

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Backend Setup**: Ensure backend is running and database is seeded with personality questions
  - Check that `/api/v1/profiles/personality-questions` returns 10 questions
  - Verify questions have correct format with id, question, type, options, order, etc.

- [ ] **Registration Flow**: 
  - Register a new user
  - Verify navigation to personality questionnaire page
  - No white screen should appear

- [ ] **Question Loading**:
  - Verify loading spinner appears initially
  - Questions load successfully from backend
  - All 10 questions are displayed

- [ ] **UI Rendering**:
  - Multiple choice questions render correctly with all options
  - Scale questions (1-10) render correctly with all values
  - Boolean questions render correctly
  - No rendering errors in console

- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - Test with backend down - should show error message with retry button
  - Test with empty questions - should show "no questions available" message
  - Test with network error - should show appropriate error

- [ ] **Question Navigation**:
  - Can navigate forward through questions
  - Can navigate backward through questions
  - Progress indicator updates correctly
  - Cannot proceed without selecting an answer

- [ ] **Submission**:
  - Complete all 10 questions
  - Click "Terminer" button
  - Answers submit successfully with UUIDs
  - Navigate to profile setup page

## Backend Requirements

The backend must have:
1. Personality questions seeded in the database (via `DatabaseSeederService`)
2. Questions accessible at `/api/v1/profiles/personality-questions` endpoint
3. Questions must have:
   - `id` (UUID)
   - `question` (string)
   - `type` ('multiple_choice', 'scale', or 'boolean')
   - `options` (array of strings, for multiple_choice)
   - `minValue`, `maxValue` (numbers, for scale)
   - `order` (number)
   - `isActive` (boolean)
   - `isRequired` (boolean)
   - `category` (string)

## Console Logs to Monitor

When loading questions:
```
Loaded X personality questions successfully
```

When questions are empty:
```
WARNING: No personality questions found on server
```

When submitting answers:
```
Submitting X personality answers
API Answers format: [...]
```

## Expected User Experience

1. User registers successfully
2. Navigated to `/questionnaire` route
3. Brief loading spinner while questions load
4. First question appears with progress "Question 1/10"
5. User selects answer and clicks "Suivant"
6. Progress to next question
7. After 10th question, button shows "Terminer"
8. Answers submit and user navigates to profile setup

## No More White Screens!

With these fixes, users should never see a white screen on the questionnaire page. Instead, they will see:
- Loading spinner (when loading)
- Error message with retry (when error occurs)
- "No questions available" message (when questions array is empty)
- Actual questions (when loaded successfully)
