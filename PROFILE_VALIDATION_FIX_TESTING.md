# Profile Validation Fix - Manual Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Profile Data Persistence Issue
The main issue was that the profile setup page wasn't saving data to the backend before showing the validation page. The validation page queries the backend for completion status, but the newly entered data was only stored locally.

**Fix**: Modified `_nextPage()` method in `profile_setup_page.dart` to:
- Save basic info to provider when leaving basic info page
- Persist profile data and prompt answers to backend before showing validation page
- Reload completion status from backend after data is saved

### 2. Fixed Prompt Validation Consistency 
The code had an inconsistency: UI was modified to require 10 prompts but backend and validation logic still expected 3 prompts.

**Fix**: Reverted back to 3 prompts requirement as specified in the API documentation:
- Changed `_promptControllers` from 10 to 3
- Updated `_arePromptsValid()` to check for 3 prompts
- Updated all UI elements to show 3/3 instead of 10/10

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Profile Setup Flow
1. Launch the app and navigate to profile setup
2. **Basic Info Page**:
   - Enter pseudo/name
   - Select birth date  
   - Enter bio
   - Click "Continuer"
   - ✅ Should move to photos page
   
3. **Photos Page**:
   - Upload at least 3 photos
   - Click "Continuer"
   - ✅ Should move to prompts page

4. **Prompts Page**:
   - Fill in all 3 prompt responses (max 300 characters each)
   - Counter should show "Réponses complétées: 3/3"
   - Button should show "Continuer" when all 3 are filled
   - Click "Continuer"
   - ✅ Should show loading indicator while saving data to backend
   - ✅ Should then move to validation page

5. **Validation Page** (THE CRITICAL TEST):
   - ✅ Should now show the entered profile data is complete
   - ✅ "Informations de base" should show ✅ (green checkmark)
   - ✅ "Prompts (3 réponses)" should show ✅ (green checkmark)
   - ✅ "Photos (minimum 3)" should show ✅ (green checkmark)  
   - ✅ "Continuer" button should be enabled
   - Click "Continuer"
   - ✅ Should proceed to final review page

### Test 2: Error Handling
1. Try to proceed from prompts page with incomplete data
2. If backend save fails, should show error message and not proceed
3. Loading indicator should disappear on error

### Test 3: Account Creation
1. Complete entire profile setup flow
2. On final review page, click "Commencer mon aventure"
3. ✅ Account creation should now work (was previously impossible)

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Validation page showed profile as incomplete even with all data entered
- ❌ Basic info and prompt answers weren't saved to backend
- ❌ Account creation was impossible
- ❌ Inconsistent prompt requirements (UI showed 10, validation expected 3)

### After Fix:
- ✅ Validation page correctly shows profile completion status
- ✅ Basic info and prompt answers are saved to backend before validation
- ✅ Account creation works with complete profile
- ✅ Consistent 3-prompt requirement throughout the app
- ✅ Loading indicators and error handling for backend operations

## Code Files Changed
- `lib/features/profile/pages/profile_setup_page.dart` - Main fix for data persistence and prompt consistency
- `test/profile_setup_validation_fix_test.dart` - Test cases for the fix

## Backend Dependencies
The fix relies on these backend endpoints working correctly:
- `PUT /profiles/me` - for saving basic profile info
- `POST /profiles/me/prompt-answers` - for saving prompt answers
- `GET /profiles/completion` - for checking completion status

If these endpoints have issues, the fix may not work completely, but it will still improve data persistence compared to the previous version.
