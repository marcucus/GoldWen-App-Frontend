# Bio Field Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: ✅ No Alert When Bio Exceeds Character Limit
**Problem**: Users could enter more than the allowed character limit without any warning.

**Solution**: 
- Updated maxLength from 200 to 600 characters
- Added validation in three places to show alert when bio exceeds 600 characters:
  1. In `_isBasicInfoValid()` - disables the "Continuer" button
  2. In `_nextPage()` - shows alert when trying to proceed to next page
  3. In `_finishSetup()` - shows alert when trying to complete profile setup

**Alert Message**: "La bio dépasse la limite de 600 caractères (XXX/600)"

---

### Issue 2: ✅ Bio Label Should Stay Visible
**Problem**: The "BIO" label should remain visible even when the field is empty.

**Solution**: 
- The EnhancedTextField already uses `labelText: 'Bio'` which automatically floats above the field in Flutter's Material design
- When empty: the label appears in the field
- When focused or filled: the label floats above the field
- This is the standard Material Design behavior and works correctly

**No code change required** - already implemented correctly.

---

### Issue 3: ✅ Character Limit Includes Spaces and Line Breaks
**Problem**: Character counting should include all characters (spaces, newlines, etc.) and limit should be 600.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `maxLength` from 200 to 600
- Flutter's TextField with `maxLength` automatically counts ALL characters including:
  - Letters
  - Numbers  
  - Spaces
  - Line breaks (\n)
  - Special characters
- The character counter (enabled with `enableCounter: true`) shows real-time count

**Backend Note**: The backend should also validate this limit on `PATCH /api/v1/profiles/me` or `POST /api/v1/profiles/me` for the `bio` field.

## Code Changes

### File Modified
`lib/features/profile/pages/profile_setup_page.dart`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Bio Field Configuration (Line 342)
```dart
// Before:
maxLength: 200,

// After:
maxLength: 600,
```

#### 2. Enhanced _isBasicInfoValid() Method (Line 945-950)
```dart
bool _isBasicInfoValid() {
  return _nameController.text.isNotEmpty &&
      _birthDate != null &&
      _bioController.text.isNotEmpty &&
      _bioController.text.length <= 600;  // Added
}
```

#### 3. Added Validation in _nextPage() Method (Line 1019-1031)
```dart
// Validate basic info when leaving basic info page
if (_currentPage == 0) {
  // Check bio length
  if (_bioController.text.length > 600) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(
        content: Text(
            'La bio dépasse la limite de 600 caractères (${_bioController.text.length}/600)'),
        backgroundColor: Colors.red,
      ),
    );
    return;
  }
}
```

#### 4. Added Validation in _finishSetup() Method (Line 1161-1173)
```dart
// Validate bio length (including spaces and line breaks)
if (_bioController.text.length > 600) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text(
          'La bio dépasse la limite de 600 caractères (${_bioController.text.length}/600)'),
      backgroundColor: Colors.red,
    ),
  );
  return;
}
```

### Test File Created
`test/bio_validation_test.dart`

Tests include:
- Bio field maxLength verification
- Label visibility test
- Character counting with spaces and newlines
- Character limit validation logic

## Manual Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Bio Field Label Visibility
1. Open the app and navigate to profile setup (step 1/6)
2. Locate the Bio field
3. **Expected**: The label "Bio" should be visible above or within the field
4. **Expected**: The hint text "Décrivez-vous en quelques mots..." should be visible when empty
5. Start typing in the bio field
6. **Expected**: The label "Bio" should float above the field and remain visible

### Test Case 2: Character Counter Display
1. Open the bio field in profile setup
2. Start typing text
3. **Expected**: A character counter should appear below the field showing "X/600"
4. Type more text (e.g., 50 characters)
5. **Expected**: Counter should show "50/600"
6. Continue typing up to 600 characters
7. **Expected**: Counter should show "600/600"

### Test Case 3: Character Counter Includes Spaces and Newlines
1. Type: "Hello world" (11 characters including space)
2. **Expected**: Counter shows "11/600"
3. Press Enter to create a new line
4. Type: "New line" (9 characters)
5. **Expected**: Counter shows "20/600" (11 + newline + 9 = 21, but trimmed to 20)
6. Add multiple spaces: "test    test" (12 characters)
7. **Expected**: All spaces are counted in the 600 limit

### Test Case 4: Character Limit Validation - Continue Button
1. Fill in Pseudo field with valid text
2. Select a birth date
3. Type exactly 600 characters in bio field
4. **Expected**: "Continuer" button should be enabled
5. Type one more character (601 total)
6. **Expected**: "Continuer" button should become disabled
7. Delete one character back to 600
8. **Expected**: "Continuer" button should be enabled again

### Test Case 5: Character Limit Validation - Alert on Next Page
1. Fill in all fields on page 1 (Pseudo, Birth date, Bio)
2. Type more than 600 characters in bio field (e.g., 650 characters)
3. Try to click "Continuer" button
4. **Expected**: Button should be disabled (won't be clickable)
5. Delete characters to get to exactly 600
6. Click "Continuer"
7. **Expected**: Should proceed to next page without alert

### Test Case 6: Character Limit Validation - Alert on Finish
1. Complete all profile setup steps
2. On the final validation page, if bio somehow exceeds 600 characters
3. Try to finish setup
4. **Expected**: Red snackbar alert appears with message "La bio dépasse la limite de 600 caractères (XXX/600)"
5. Go back and reduce bio to 600 characters or less
6. **Expected**: Setup should complete successfully

### Test Case 7: Bio Content Persistence
1. Enter 500 characters in bio field
2. Navigate to next page (photos)
3. Navigate back to basic info page
4. **Expected**: Bio text should still be there with same character count
5. **Expected**: Character counter should show "500/600"

## Validation Behavior Summary

| Scenario | Character Count | Button State | Alert Shown | Can Proceed |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Empty bio | 0 | Disabled | No | No |
| Valid bio (1-600) | 1-600 | Enabled | No | Yes |
| At limit | 600 | Enabled | No | Yes |
| Over limit | 601+ | Disabled | Yes (if attempted) | No |

---

## Key Features

✅ **Real-time validation**: Button state updates as user types
✅ **Character counter**: Shows current/max (X/600) 
✅ **Comprehensive counting**: Includes spaces, newlines, all characters
✅ **Multiple validation points**: Button disable, page navigation, and final submission
✅ **User-friendly alerts**: Clear error messages with actual character count
✅ **Label persistence**: "Bio" label always visible per Material Design standards

---

## Backend Integration Notes

The backend API should also validate the bio field:

**Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/v1/profiles/me` or `POST /api/v1/profiles/me`

**Field**: `bio`

**Validation Rules**:
- Maximum length: 600 characters
- Should count all characters including spaces and newlines
- Return appropriate error if exceeded

**Example validation error**:
```json
{
  "error": "Bio exceeds maximum length of 600 characters",
  "field": "bio",
  "current_length": 650,
  "max_length": 600
}
```

## Completion Status

✅ All three issues from the problem statement have been resolved:
