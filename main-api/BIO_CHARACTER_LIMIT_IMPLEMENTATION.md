# Bio Character Limit Update - Implementation Documentation

## Issue Requirements
- Increase bio character limit from 500 to 600 characters
- Ensure spaces and line breaks are counted in the total
- Add backend validation to enforce the new limit
- Provide clear error messages

## Routes Affected
- `PUT /api/v1/profiles/me` - Updates user profile (including bio field)

## Implementation Details

### 1. DTO Changes
**File:** `main-api/src/modules/profiles/dto/profiles.dto.ts`

#### UpdateProfileDto
- Changed `@MaxLength(500)` to `@MaxLength(600)` on the `bio` field
- This enforces validation at the API layer using class-validator

#### ProfileResponseDto
- Updated API documentation from `maxLength: 500` to `maxLength: 600`
- This ensures OpenAPI/Swagger documentation reflects the new limit

### 2. Validation Behavior
The `@MaxLength` decorator from `class-validator` uses JavaScript's native `string.length` property, which:
- ✅ Counts all characters including letters, numbers, symbols
- ✅ Counts spaces as 1 character each
- ✅ Counts newlines (`\n`) as 1 character each
- ✅ Counts tabs and other whitespace characters

**No additional custom validation logic was required** because the standard `string.length` behavior already meets the requirements.

### 3. Error Messages
When a bio exceeds 600 characters, the API returns:
```
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["bio must be shorter than or equal to 600 characters"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

This error message:
- Clearly indicates the field name (`bio`)
- States the exact limit (`600 characters`)
- Is automatically generated by class-validator

### 4. Testing
Created comprehensive test coverage:

#### bio-validation.spec.ts (6 tests)
Tests service-level behavior:
- Accepts bio with exactly 600 characters
- Counts spaces in the limit
- Counts newlines in the limit
- Handles mixed content (text, spaces, newlines)
- Handles moderation rejection
- Accepts short bios

#### bio-dto-validation.spec.ts (12 tests)
Tests DTO-level validation:
- Validates 600 character limit enforcement
- Confirms 601+ characters are rejected
- Verifies spaces and newlines are counted
- Tests optional field behavior
- Tests type validation

### 5. Database Schema
**No database migration required.**

The `profile.entity.ts` file defines the `bio` column as:
```typescript
@Column({ nullable: true })
bio: string;
```

This uses the database's default text column type, which can store strings much larger than 600 characters. The validation happens at the API layer only.

## Test Results
```
✅ All 12 profile test suites passing (95 tests total)
✅ Build successful
✅ No regressions in existing functionality
```

## API Routes Documentation

### PUT /api/v1/profiles/me
**Description:** Update current user profile

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "bio": "string (max 600 characters)"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "firstName": "John",
  "bio": "Updated biography...",
  ...
}
```

**Error Response (400 - Bio too long):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["bio must be shorter than or equal to 600 characters"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

**Error Response (400 - Inappropriate content):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Bio rejected: Contains inappropriate language",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ API rejects bios longer than 600 characters
- ✅ Spaces and newlines are counted in the limit
- ✅ Error message clearly indicates the rule

## Notes
- The issue mentioned POST and PATCH routes, but the actual implementation uses PUT for profile updates
- This is consistent with REST best practices (PUT for full/partial resource updates)
- The validation applies to any route that uses `UpdateProfileDto`, ensuring consistency
