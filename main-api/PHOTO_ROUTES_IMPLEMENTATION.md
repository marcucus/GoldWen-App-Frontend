# Photo Management Routes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the three photo management routes requested in the issue.

## Routes Implemented

### 1. PUT /api/v1/profiles/me/photos/:photoId/order
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

**Purpose:** Update the display order of a photo (for drag & drop functionality)

**Controller:** `ProfilesController.updatePhotoOrder()` (lines 135-152)

**Service:** `ProfilesService.updatePhotoOrder()` (lines 281-340)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "newOrder": 1  // Must be between 1 and total number of photos
}
```

**Response:** Returns the updated Photo object
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "order": 1,
  "url": "/uploads/photos/filename.jpg",
  "isPrimary": false,
  // ... other photo fields
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Validates photo exists and belongs to user
- ✅ Validates newOrder is between 1 and total photos count
- ✅ Automatically adjusts other photos' order positions
- ✅ Uses database query builder for efficient bulk updates

**Error Handling:**
- `404 NotFoundException`: Profile or photo not found
- `400 BadRequestException`: Invalid order value

### 2. PUT /api/v1/profiles/me/photos/:photoId/primary
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

**Purpose:** Set a specific photo as the primary/main profile photo

**Controller:** `ProfilesController.setPrimaryPhoto()` (lines 121-133)

**Service:** `ProfilesService.setPrimaryPhoto()` (lines 255-279)

**Request Body:** None required

**Response:** Returns the updated Photo object
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "isPrimary": true,
  "url": "/uploads/photos/filename.jpg",
  "order": 2,
  // ... other photo fields
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Validates photo exists and belongs to user
- ✅ Ensures only one photo can be primary (clears other photos' primary status)

**Error Handling:**
- `404 NotFoundException`: Profile or photo not found

---

### 3. GET /api/v1/profiles/completion
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented (Enhanced to match frontend expectations)

**Purpose:** Get detailed profile completion status including photo requirements

**Controller:** `ProfilesController.getProfileCompletion()` (lines 63-69)

**Service:** `ProfilesService.getProfileCompletion()` (lines 600-794)

**Request Body:** None (uses authenticated user from JWT)

**Response Format:** (Aligned with TACHES_FRONTEND.md specifications)
```json
{
  "isComplete": boolean,
  "completionPercentage": number,
  "requirements": {
    "minimumPhotos": {
      "required": 3,
      "current": number,
      "satisfied": boolean
    },
    "minimumPrompts": {
      "required": number,
      "current": number,
      "satisfied": boolean,
      "missing": [
        {
          "id": "uuid",
          "text": "Prompt text"
        }
      ]
    },
    "personalityQuestionnaire": {
      "required": true,
      "completed": boolean,
      "satisfied": boolean
    },
    "basicInfo": boolean
  },
  "missingSteps": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "nextStep": "Next action to take"
}
```

**Requirements Checked:**
- ✅ Minimum 3 photos uploaded
- ✅ All required prompts answered
- ✅ Personality questionnaire completed
- ✅ Basic info filled (birthDate, bio)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Renamed `promptAnswers` to `minimumPrompts` (frontend expectation)
- ✅ Changed `personalityQuestionnaire` from boolean to object with `{required, completed, satisfied}` (frontend expectation)
- ✅ Added `missing` array to show which prompts are still needed

---

## Test Coverage

All three routes have comprehensive test coverage:

1. **photo-routes-integration.spec.ts** (NEW)
   - Integration tests specifically for the three requested routes
   - Validates all requirements from specifications.md and TACHES_FRONTEND.md
   - Tests success cases, error handling, and edge cases

2. **photo-management.spec.ts** (UPDATED)
   - Updated to match new completion response format
   - Added ModerationService mock

3. **profile-completion-validation.spec.ts** (UPDATED)
   - Updated to match new completion response format
   - Added test for new response structure
   - Added ModerationService mock

## Compliance with Specifications

### specifications.md Requirements
- ✅ Minimum 3 photos enforced before profile is visible (Module 1, section 4.1)
- ✅ Photo order management for profile display
- ✅ Primary photo designation
- ✅ Profile completion validation before matching

### TACHES_FRONTEND.md Requirements
- ✅ PUT /api/v1/profiles/me/photos/:photoId/order endpoint
- ✅ PUT /api/v1/profiles/me/photos/:photoId/primary endpoint
- ✅ GET /api/v1/profiles/completion endpoint with correct response format
- ✅ Response includes all fields expected by frontend:
  - `minimumPhotos` (not `photos`)
  - `minimumPrompts` (not `promptAnswers`)
  - `personalityQuestionnaire` as object (not boolean)

### TACHES_BACKEND.md Requirements
- ✅ All three routes implemented as specified
- ✅ Photo reorganization functional
- ✅ Primary photo correctly defined
- ✅ Completion endpoint returns all necessary information

## API Documentation

All routes are documented in Swagger/OpenAPI:
- Available at: `/api/v1/docs` in development mode
- Each route has `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse` decorators
- Request/Response DTOs are properly typed

## Security

All three routes are protected:
- ✅ `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` - Requires authentication
- ✅ `@SkipProfileCompletion()` - Allows access during profile setup
- ✅ `@ApiBearerAuth()` - Requires JWT token in Authorization header
- ✅ User can only modify their own photos (validated in service layer)

## SOLID Principles Compliance

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each method has one clear purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Service methods are open for extension
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Repository interfaces properly used
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clean DTOs for each endpoint
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies injected via constructor

## Performance Considerations

1. **Photo Ordering**: Uses database query builder for bulk updates instead of individual saves
2. **Completion Status**: Single query with relations to fetch all needed data
3. **Primary Photo**: Bulk update to clear primary status efficiently

## Conclusion

All three requested photo management routes are fully implemented, tested, and aligned with both backend (specifications.md) and frontend (TACHES_FRONTEND.md) requirements. The implementation follows SOLID principles, includes proper error handling, and has comprehensive test coverage.
