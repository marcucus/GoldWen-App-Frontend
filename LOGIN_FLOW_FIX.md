# Login Flow Fix - Navigation Logic

## Problem
When users logged in, they were always being redirected to the user information pages and questionnaire, even when they had already completed the onboarding process.

## Solution
Modified the splash page navigation logic to properly check both completion flags before redirecting to the home page.

## Changes Made

### Before
```dart
if (user.isProfileCompleted == true) {
  // Profile completed and has location, initialize location service and go to main app
  LocationService().initialize();
  if (mounted) {
    context.go('/home');
  }
  return;
}
```

### After  
```dart
if (user.isOnboardingCompleted == true && user.isProfileCompleted == true) {
  // Both onboarding and profile completed, initialize location service and go to main app
  LocationService().initialize();
  if (mounted) {
    context.go('/home');
  }
  return;
}
```

## Navigation Logic
The new navigation logic follows these rules:

1. **Both flags true** (`isOnboardingCompleted == true && isProfileCompleted == true`)
   → Redirect to `/home` (connected home page)

2. **Only onboarding true** (`isOnboardingCompleted == true` but `isProfileCompleted != true`)
   → Redirect to `/profile-setup` (profile setup page)

3. **Neither or onboarding false** (`isOnboardingCompleted != true`)
   → Redirect to `/questionnaire` (user questions/information page)

## Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests in `test/splash_navigation_test.dart` to validate all navigation scenarios including edge cases with null values.
