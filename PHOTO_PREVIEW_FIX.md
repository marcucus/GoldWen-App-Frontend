# Fix: Photo Preview Display Issue (Step 2/6)

## Problem
After adding a photo at step 2/6, the preview was not displaying correctly. The widget did not update to show the newly added photo.

## Root Cause
The `PhotoManagementWidget` maintains its own internal state (`_photos`) that was initialized in `initState()` but never updated when the parent's `widget.photos` prop changed. 

When a photo was added via the `ProfileProvider`, the provider's state was updated correctly, but the `PhotoManagementWidget` continued to display the old state because it didn't respond to the prop change.

## Solution
Implemented the `didUpdateWidget` lifecycle method to sync the local `_photos` state with the incoming `widget.photos` prop whenever it changes.

### Code Change
**File:** `lib/features/profile/widgets/photo_management_widget.dart`

Added the following lifecycle method after `initState()`:

```dart
@override
void didUpdateWidget(PhotoManagementWidget oldWidget) {
  super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
  // Update local state when the photos prop changes from parent
  if (widget.photos != oldWidget.photos) {
    _photos = List.from(widget.photos);
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Before the fix:**
   - User adds a photo → `ProfileProvider.updatePhotos()` is called
   - `ProfileProvider` updates its state → triggers rebuild
   - `Consumer<ProfileProvider>` rebuilds and passes new photos to `PhotoManagementWidget`
   - ❌ `PhotoManagementWidget` receives new props but ignores them (no preview update)

2. **After the fix:**
   - User adds a photo → `ProfileProvider.updatePhotos()` is called
   - `ProfileProvider` updates its state → triggers rebuild
   - `Consumer<ProfileProvider>` rebuilds and passes new photos to `PhotoManagementWidget`
   - ✅ `didUpdateWidget` detects the prop change and updates `_photos`
   - ✅ Widget rebuilds with updated state (preview displays correctly)

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite in `test/photo_preview_update_test.dart` covering:
- Adding single photo
- Adding multiple photos
- Removing photos
- Reaching maximum photos
- Preserving primary photo indicator
- Count display updates

## Impact
- **Minimal code change:** Only 7 lines added
- **No breaking changes:** Existing functionality preserved
- **Fixes the issue:** Preview now updates correctly after photo addition
- **No performance impact:** Only updates when props actually change

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to profile setup step 2/6
2. Add a photo using the camera or gallery
3. Observe that the photo preview appears immediately in the grid
4. Verify the photo count updates correctly (e.g., "1/6 photos (min 3)")
5. Add more photos and verify all previews update correctly
6. Check that the first photo is marked as "Principal"
