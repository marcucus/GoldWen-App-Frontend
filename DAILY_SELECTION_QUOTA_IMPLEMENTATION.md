# Daily Selection Quota Implementation - Technical Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the daily selection quota system for the GoldWen dating app frontend, which enforces limits on the number of profiles a user can select per day.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Quota Enforcement Based on Subscription Tier
- **Free Users**: 1 selection per day
- **Premium Users (GoldWen Plus)**: 3 selections per day
- Quotas are enforced both client-side and server-side

### 2. Enhanced Data Models

#### SubscriptionUsage Model Updates
- Added `dailyChoicesUsed` and `dailyChoicesLimit` fields
- Supports both new API format with `dailyChoices` object and fallback to existing format
- Includes `hasRemainingChoices` and `remainingChoices` getters

#### DailySelection Model Updates  
- Added quota metadata: `choicesRemaining`, `choicesMade`, `maxChoices`
- Added `canSelectMore` and `isSelectionComplete` getters for UI logic
- Robust JSON parsing that handles both `metadata` wrapper and direct field formats
- Graceful fallback to default values when backend data is incomplete

### 3. Provider Logic Enhancements

#### MatchingProvider Updates
- Uses backend metadata for quota information when available
- Falls back to subscription-based limits if metadata unavailable
- Updates selection state after each API call
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Selection completion detection based on backend data rather than local state

### 4. User Interface Improvements

#### Daily Matches Page
- Shows selection complete state when quotas are reached
- Hides remaining profiles after quota exhaustion
- Displays selection counter with remaining choices
- Upgrade prompts for free users approaching limits

#### Enhanced Confirmation Dialog
- Shows remaining choices after selection
- Special messaging for final selection
- Upgrade suggestions for free users
- Better visual hierarchy with color-coded information

#### Improved Success/Error Messages
- Context-aware success messages based on remaining selections  
- Clear completion messages when daily limit reached
- Informative error messages for various failure scenarios

### 5. Comprehensive Test Coverage

#### Model Tests (`test/daily_selection_quota_test.dart`)
- JSON parsing validation for both metadata and direct formats
- Edge case handling for missing or incomplete data
- Quota calculation correctness

#### Provider Logic Tests (`test/matching_provider_quota_test.dart`) 
- Selection state management validation
- Completion detection accuracy
- Error handling verification

#### UI Tests (`test/daily_matches_page_test.dart`)
- Updated with proper mockito generation
- Coverage for selection complete states
- Proper provider mocking for all new methods

## API Integration

The system integrates with these backend endpoints:

### GET /matching/daily-selection
Expected response format:
```json
{
  "profiles": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "choicesRemaining": 2,
    "choicesMade": 1,
    "maxChoices": 3,
    "refreshTime": "2023-12-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### POST /matching/choose/:profileId  
Expected response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "isMatch": false,
    "choicesRemaining": 1,
    "message": "Profile selected successfully"
  }
}
```

### GET /subscriptions/usage
Expected response format:
```json
{
  "dailyChoices": {
    "used": 1,
    "limit": 3, 
    "remaining": 2,
    "resetTime": "2023-12-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "subscription": {
    "tier": "premium",
    "isActive": true
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Daily Selection Loading**: System loads profiles with quota metadata
2. **Quota Display**: User sees remaining selections prominently displayed  
3. **Profile Selection**: Confirmation dialog shows impact of selection
4. **Quota Updates**: Real-time updates after each selection
5. **Completion State**: Clear messaging when quota exhausted
6. **Upgrade Prompts**: Contextual suggestions for premium features

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
- **Backend Inconsistencies**: Robust parsing with sensible defaults
- **Missing Data**: Fallback to safe default values (1 choice for free users)
- **Selection Conflicts**: Prevention of duplicate selections
- **Session Consistency**: Proper state management across app lifecycle

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Model JSON parsing and validation
- Provider state management
- UI component behavior
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases and fallback logic

## Implementation Notes

- All changes are minimal and surgical to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained for evolving backend API
- Production-ready error handling without debug logging
- Follows established app patterns and architecture
- Comprehensive type safety and null handling

This implementation fully addresses the requirements for daily selection quotas while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
