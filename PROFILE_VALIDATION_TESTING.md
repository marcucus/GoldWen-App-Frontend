# Profile Validation Implementation - Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive testing guide for the profile validation feature implementation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Profile Setup Flow
**Scenario**: New user completing profile setup

**Steps**:
1. Start app as new user 
2. Complete onboarding (personality questionnaire)
3. Navigate to profile setup
4. Complete basic info page (name, birth date, bio)
5. Add 3 photos (minimum required)
6. Answer 3 prompts
7. Navigate to validation page (new page 4)
8. Verify profile completion status shows all requirements met
9. Click "Continuer" - should be enabled
10. Complete final setup - should successfully navigate to main app

**Expected Results**:
- Validation page shows green checkmarks for all requirements
- Progress indicator shows 100%
- No missing steps displayed
- Profile activation succeeds
- User can access main app features

### 2. Incomplete Profile Prevention
**Scenario**: User with incomplete profile tries to access main app

**Steps**:
1. Set up profile with missing requirements (e.g., only 2 photos)
2. Try to finish profile setup
3. Navigate to validation page
4. Verify profile shows incomplete status
5. Try to continue - button should be disabled or show warning
6. Complete missing requirements
7. Return to validation page - should now show complete

**Expected Results**:
- Validation page shows warning/incomplete status
- Missing steps clearly listed
- Cannot proceed until complete
- Progress indicator shows correct percentage
- After completion, can proceed successfully

### 3. Navigation Protection
**Scenario**: User with incomplete profile accessing main navigation

**Steps**:
1. Somehow access main navigation with incomplete profile
2. App should detect incomplete profile
3. User should be redirected to profile setup

**Expected Results**:
- Automatic redirect to profile setup
- Cannot access main app features
- Loading indicator while checking profile status

### 4. User Profile Page Integration
**Scenario**: Viewing profile completion in user profile

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to user profile page
2. View profile completion widget
3. Check progress and missing steps
4. Click "Compl√©ter le profil" if incomplete

**Expected Results**:
- Profile completion widget displays correctly
- Shows current progress and status
- Missing steps are clearly indicated
- Button navigates to profile setup

### 5. API Integration
**Scenario**: Profile completion data from backend

**Test with mock data**:
```json
{
  "isCompleted": false,
  "hasPhotos": true,
  "hasPrompts": false,
  "hasPersonalityAnswers": true,
  "hasRequiredProfileFields": false,
  "missingSteps": [
    "Answer 3 prompts",
    "Complete basic profile information: birth date, bio"
  ]
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- UI reflects backend completion status
- Missing steps match backend response
- Progress calculation is accurate

## Validation Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Displays correctly in user profile page
- [ ] Progress bar shows accurate percentage
- [ ] Missing steps are clearly listed
- [ ] Button states (enabled/disabled) work correctly
- [ ] Colors and icons match completion status

### Navigation Flow

## Known Issues/Limitations

1. Profile completion is checked client-side - relies on backend completion flags
2. Network errors may cause inconsistent states
3. Some edge cases with simultaneous profile updates may need handling

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time validation as user completes sections
2. More granular progress tracking
3. Profile completion tips and guidance
4. Gamification elements for completion
