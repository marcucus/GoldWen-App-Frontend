# Fixes Applied for User Registration Issues

## Problem Statement
Three main issues were identified in the onboarding and profile completion flow:

1. **Missing Onboarding Pages**: Gender, preferences, location, additional info pages were not displayed during registration
2. **Limited Prompts**: Backend only returned 3 prompts instead of all available prompts for users to select from
3. **Completion Flags Not Set**: `isOnboardingCompleted` and `isProfileCompleted` flags were not being set to true in the database

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Missing Onboarding Pages
**Root Cause**: After completing the personality questionnaire, the app was navigating directly to `/profile-setup`, skipping all the onboarding pages (gender selection, gender preferences, location setup, preferences setup, additional info).

**Location**: `lib/features/onboarding/pages/personality_questionnaire_page.dart`, line 618

### Issue 2: Limited Prompts
**Root Cause**: The backend `getPrompts()` method had `take: 3` which limited the query to only 3 prompts, instead of returning all available prompts for users to choose from.

**Location**: `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.service.ts`, line 422

### Issue 3: Completion Flags Not Set
**Root Cause**: API mismatch - the frontend was sending `completed: true` but the backend DTO expected `isVisible: true`. This caused the profile status update to fail silently.

**Location**: 
- Frontend: `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`, line 276
- Backend DTO: `main-api/src/modules/profiles/dto/profiles.dto.ts`

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Onboarding Flow Navigation
**File**: `lib/features/onboarding/pages/personality_questionnaire_page.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `GenderSelectionPage`
- Changed navigation from `context.go('/profile-setup')` to `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const GenderSelectionPage()))`
- This ensures the full onboarding flow is executed: Personality → Gender → Gender Preferences → Location → Preferences → Additional Info → Profile Setup

### Fix 2: Return All Prompts
**File**: `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.service.ts`

**Changes**:
- Removed `take: 3` from the `getPrompts()` query
- Updated comment to clarify that ALL active prompts are returned and users select any 3
- Updated controller documentation to match

**File**: `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.controller.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated API documentation description to state "Returns all active prompts. Users can select and answer any 3 of them."

### Fix 3: Profile Completion Status API
**File**: `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`

**Changes**:
- Changed `updateProfileStatus` method signature from accepting `completed` parameter to `isVisible` parameter
- Updated request body to send `isVisible` instead of `completed`

**File**: `lib/features/profile/providers/profile_provider.dart`

**Changes**:
- Updated call to `ApiService.updateProfileStatus(isVisible: true)` instead of `completed: true`

**File**: `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.service.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive debug logging to `updateProfileCompletionStatus` method
- Logs include:
  - All validation checks (photos, prompts, personality, profile fields)
  - Current vs calculated completion status
  - Before/after values when flags are updated
- This will help diagnose any future issues with completion flags

## Validation Logic

The backend correctly validates profile completion with these criteria:

1. **isOnboardingCompleted = true** when:
   - All required personality questions are answered

2. **isProfileCompleted = true** when ALL of:
   - At least 3 photos uploaded
   - Exactly 3 prompts answered
   - All required personality questions answered
   - Both birthDate and bio are provided

The `updateProfileCompletionStatus` is automatically called after:
- `submitPersonalityAnswers()`
- `updateProfile()`
- `submitPromptAnswers()`
- `uploadPhotos()`
- `deletePhoto()`
- `updateProfileStatus()`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Full Onboarding Flow**:
   - Create new user account
   - Complete personality questionnaire
   - Verify navigation to gender selection page
   - Complete all onboarding pages: gender → preferences → location → age/distance → additional info
   - Verify all data is saved to the profile

2. **Test Prompts Selection**:
   - Verify that more than 3 prompts are available to choose from
   - Verify users can select any 3 prompts from the full list
   - Test that submitting exactly 3 prompts works correctly

3. **Test Completion Flags**:
   - Monitor backend logs for `[updateProfileCompletionStatus]` entries
   - After completing personality: verify `isOnboardingCompleted = true` in database
   - After completing entire profile: verify both flags are `true` in database
   - Check that profile becomes visible to other users only when both flags are true

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Registration Flow**:
   ```
   Sign Up → Personality Questionnaire → Gender Selection → Gender Preferences → 
   Location Setup → Preferences (Age/Distance) → Additional Info → 
   Profile Setup (Photos & Prompts) → Validation → Home
   ```

2. **Prompts**:
   - Users see all available prompts (10+ options)
   - Users can select any 3 prompts to answer
   - Profile completion requires exactly 3 prompt answers

3. **Completion Flags**:
   - `isOnboardingCompleted` becomes `true` after personality questionnaire
   - `isProfileCompleted` becomes `true` after all requirements are met
   - Backend logs show detailed validation status
   - Users can proceed to main app only when profile is complete

## Files Modified

### Frontend (Flutter)
1. `lib/features/onboarding/pages/personality_questionnaire_page.dart`
2. `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`
3. `lib/features/profile/providers/profile_provider.dart`

### Backend (NestJS)
1. `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.service.ts`
2. `main-api/src/modules/profiles/profiles.controller.ts`

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required - the fixes are code-only changes.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Restoring the previous navigation to `/profile-setup` in personality_questionnaire_page.dart
2. Re-adding `take: 3` to the prompts query
3. Reverting the API parameter name changes

All changes are backward compatible with existing data.
