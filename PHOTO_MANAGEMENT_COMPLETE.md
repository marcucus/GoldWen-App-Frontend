## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **PhotoManagementWidget** (`photo_management_widget.dart`)
   - Core widget with drag & drop
   - Image compression logic
   - Backend synchronization
   - State management

2. **Compression Algorithm** (`_compressImage()`)
   ```dart
   Input: Image up to 10MB
   Process: 
   - Check if already < 1MB ‚Üí Return original
   - Compress with quality 85%
   - If still > 1MB, reduce quality by 10%
   - Repeat until < 1MB or quality = 50%
   Output: Compressed image ‚â§ 1MB
   ```

3. **Primary Photo Logic**
   ```
   Upload ‚Üí First photo = primary (auto)
   Reorder ‚Üí Position 0 = primary (auto)
   Delete primary ‚Üí Next photo = primary (auto)
   Set primary ‚Üí Move to position 0
   ```

### Backend API Integration

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/profiles/me/photos` | POST | Upload photo | ‚úÖ |
| `/photos/:id/order` | PUT | Update order | ‚úÖ |
| `/photos/:id/primary` | PUT | Set primary | ‚úÖ |
| `/photos/:id` | DELETE | Delete photo | ‚úÖ |
