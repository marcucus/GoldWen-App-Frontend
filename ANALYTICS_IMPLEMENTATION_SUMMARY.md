## Event Coverage

### Onboarding Journey
1. ✅ Signup started (method: email/google/apple)
2. ✅ Signup completed
3. ✅ Personality quiz completed
4. ✅ Profile completed

### Daily Matching Journey
1. ✅ Daily selection viewed
2. ✅ Profile chosen/passed
3. ✅ Match created

### Chat Journey
1. ✅ First message sent
2. ✅ Messages sent (ongoing)
3. ✅ Chat expired

### Subscription Journey

2. ✅ Subscription started
3. ✅ Subscription cancelled/restored

## GDPR Compliance

### ✅ Implemented Requirements

1. **Opt-In by Default**: Analytics are disabled until user explicitly consents
2. **Clear Consent**: Users see analytics option in GDPR consent modal
3. **Easy Opt-Out**: Users can disable analytics in Privacy Settings anytime
4. **Immediate Effect**: Opt-out takes effect immediately
5. **Data Minimization**: Only behavioral events tracked, no PII sent to Mixpanel
6. **Right to be Forgotten**: Analytics reset on account deletion

### Consent Flow

```
App Launch → GDPR Modal → User Choice
                              ↓
                    Analytics Enabled?
                    ↓               ↓
                  Yes              No
                    ↓               ↓
            Events Tracked    Events Blocked
```

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
mixpanel_flutter: ^2.3.1  # Official Mixpanel SDK for Flutter
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Development
flutter run --dart-define=MIXPANEL_TOKEN=dev_token

# Production
flutter build apk --dart-define=MIXPANEL_TOKEN=prod_token
```

### File-based Configuration

```bash
# Create config file
cp .env.analytics.template .env.analytics

# Edit with your token
nano .env.analytics

# Run with config
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.analytics
```

## Testing Checklist

## What Needs Manual Verification

1. **Mixpanel Account Setup**: User needs to create account and get token
2. **Token Configuration**: Add production token to build configuration
3. **Dashboard Setup**: Create Mixpanel dashboards and funnels

5. **GDPR Flow Testing**: Manual test of consent enable/disable
6. **Production Monitoring**: Monitor analytics in production environment

## Next Steps for User

1. Create Mixpanel account (free tier available)
2. Get project token from Mixpanel dashboard
3. Configure token in app (see ANALYTICS_QUICK_START.md)
4. Build and run app
5. Enable analytics consent in GDPR modal
6. Perform user actions
7. Verify events in Mixpanel dashboard
8. Create recommended dashboards
9. Set up alerts for key metrics

## Code Quality
